## Problem Title
SIH1392: E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Background:
E-waste, or electronic waste, refers to discarded electrical or electronic devices that contain harmful components such as lead, mercury, and cadmium. Improper disposal of e-waste poses serious threats to the environment and human health.

Description:
The challenge is to develop a website that helps users locate the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facilities. The website should provide awareness about harmful components in e-waste, educate users on safe disposal practices, and promote recycling habits. Users can also input their old device model and earn credit points based on the recoverable precious metals, encouraging responsible disposal.

Expected Solution:
A user-friendly website that displays nearby e-waste collection centers on a map and provides educational pop-ups about the effects of improper e-waste disposal. The platform should also include a points-based incentive feature to promote eco-friendly behavior. 

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Environment

## Idea
The proposed idea is to build a centralized online platform where users can easily find their nearest e-waste recycling or collection centers.
The site will educate users about the importance of safe disposal through short, interactive messages and reward points.

## conclusion:
The E-Waste Facility Locator project aims to promote environmental awareness and responsible disposal of electronic waste through a simple and accessible web platform. By helping users easily find nearby recycling centers and educating them on the harmful effects of e-waste, the system contributes toward a cleaner, greener, and more sustainable future.

This idea not only supports environmental protection but also encourages citizens to actively participate in the recycling process through informative features and potential reward systems. The platform can be further expanded into a mobile app and integrated with government initiatives to create a nationwide e-waste management network.
